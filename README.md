Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Project
---
##Procedure
Takes an input signal(0-4kHz) and yields an output signal centered around 30 kHz in order to transmit. Both transmitter and receiver parts are implemented in Matlab.

##MatlabSimulation.m 
It takes a synthetic signal(cosine signal) and returns the output of the procedure in the Matlab Simulation folder.
##SoundMatlabSimulation.m
It takes a *real* sound signal and does the same procedure.
